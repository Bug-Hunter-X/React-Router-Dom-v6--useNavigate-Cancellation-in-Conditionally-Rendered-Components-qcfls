In React Router Dom v6, when navigating using the useNavigate hook within a component that's conditionally rendered, you might encounter unexpected behavior if the component unmounts before the navigation completes.  This can happen if the navigation triggers an asynchronous action (e.g., an API call) that takes longer than the component's unmounting process. The navigation might be cancelled, resulting in a no-op or unexpected route transitions.
